## Development

**[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/zh-Hans/)** instead of NPM is required.

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
yarn start

# run production build
yarn run build
```

## Deployment

Copy built files (`npm run build` then the files are on `./public`) to `/docs` then push to master. GitHub will deploy it on GitHub Pages.

## Credits

Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - the blazing-fast static site generator for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
